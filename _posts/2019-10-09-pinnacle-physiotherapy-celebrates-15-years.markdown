  <p>It was in the year 2000 that founder Ritch Coughlin opened the first clinic in Tecumseh under the name Pinnacle Rehabilitation, a complimentary service to an already established ergonomic consulting firm.&nbsp; His vision was to provide excellent care and treat every person who came in uniquely.&nbsp; He believed the key to recovery was to spend the appropriate amount of time with each patient, as dictated by their needs.&nbsp; What is more, to be able to provide these services in a positive clinical atmosphere to ensure patient success.&nbsp; It was this approach that achieved results and generated favourable word-of-mouth in the community to make Pinnacle the type of physiotherapy clinic that sees a consistent flow of patient-referrals.</p>

  <p>In 2006, Pinnacle Rehabilitation opened its second&nbsp;<a href="/locations">location at 1270 Walker Road</a>&nbsp;under the watchful eye of Senior Physiotherapist and Clinic Partner Grant Gagnon.&nbsp; There again was a commitment to get the word out about health, wellness, and how people can take an active role in their own well-being.&nbsp; This approach to patient care assisted Pinnacle in achieving their goal of providing patients with personalized treatment plans and one-on-one care.</p>

  <p>Mario Ruggirello, Clinical Kinesiologist, joined the ownership group as a Clinic Partner in 2010.&nbsp; It was at that point when Pinnacle Rehabilitation rebranded itself to Pinnacle Physiotherapy of Windsor.&nbsp; At the same time, the decision was made to relocate the flagship Tecumseh location to LaSalle, thus Pinnacle Physiotherapy of LaSalle was born.&nbsp; Located at 5881 Malden Road behind the Rexall, this busy location serves residents who hail primarily from LaSalle, Amherstburg, and Windsor and has proven to be the right decision.</p>

  <p>Everyday Pinnacle’s friendly, knowledgeable staff work hard to ensure that your health, well-being, and comfort are always a top priority and we have being doing it for 15 years! Our ‘low volume, high care’ strategy continues today. Overall, we are proud to have successfully treated thousands of patients with a patient satisfaction score of over 99%.</p>

  <p>Pinnacle Physiotherapy first and foremost offers physiotherapy services, complemented by acupuncture, women’s pelvic health, hydrotherapy, massage therapy, laser therapy, ergonomic assessments, and many more supplementary treatments.&nbsp; All physiotherapists are McKenzie trained therapists which has been highly successful, particularly in treating back and neck pain.</p>

  <p>We treat clients that have been in car accidents, work related injuries, sport injuries, and post-surgical rehabilitation. A unique feature offered at both locations is our custom gym programs for people who feel more comfortable in a rehab setting under the watchful eye&nbsp;&nbsp; of a therapist, as opposed to a gym atmosphere. We direct-bill most insurance companies and no referral is required.</p>

  <p>As big supporter of our community teams, athletes, and work force, it is our hope that after 15 years we have earned the right to treat those in our community, and that the community and those who live in it feel they are getting the best care possible.&nbsp; It is an individual’s choice where they seek treatment.&nbsp; Our goal: we want you to choose us and experience the&nbsp;<em>Pinnacle Difference</em>.</p>

  <p>Thank you for a great 15 years and here is to many more to come!</p>

  <p>A McKenzie clinician can help.</p>

  <p>Most musculoskeletal pain is mechanical in origin. This means that the pain is not due to a serious pathology, like cancer or infection, but rather a result of abnormal or unusual forces or mechanics in the tissue. The McKenzie Method of treatment is particularly effective in identifying the mechanical problem and developing a plan to correct it. The result – elimination of pain.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, too many people have spent years in therapy or going to provider to provider to resolve a particular problem. This often happens because the patient was never properly assessed, therefore, never properly treated. The McKenzie Method, however, is committed to the ongoing assessment throughout treatment until meaningful results are achieved.</p>

  <p>The treatment principles of this method promote the body’s potential to repair itself and do not involve the use of medication, heat, cold, ultrasound, needles, or surgery. McKenzie trained clinicians teach patients the principles about correcting their pain which empowers them to be in control of their own symptom management.</p>

  <h3>Q: What does the McKenzie Method treat?</h3>

  <p>A: The McKenzie Method is intended for all musculoskeletal problems, including back, neck and extremity pain (i.e., shoulder, knee, ankle etc.), as well as sciatica, sacroiliac joint pain, arthritis, degenerative disc disease, muscle spasms and intermittent numbness. If you are suffering from any such issues, then an MDT assessment may be right for you!</p>

  <h3>Q: How does it work?</h3>

  <p>A: MDT works in three steps:</p>

  <h4>1. Assessment</h4>

  <p>The McKenzie assessment begins with the trained clinician taking a detailed history about your symptoms and how they behave. A key component of the McKenzie system is the examination of repeated movements, which means that the clinician may ask you to repeat certain movements. This enables the clinician to identify specific pain patterns.</p>

  <h4>2. Treatment</h4>

  <p>The valuable information gleaned from the assessment leads the clinician to recommend the most appropriate treatment for you. The clinician will prescribe specific exercises and postural advice. A certified McKenzie clinician will provide advanced hands-on techniques to help you manage the problem.</p>

  <h4>3. Prevention</h4>

  <p>By learning how to self-treat your problem, you gain hands-on knowledge to minimize the risk of recurrence.</p>
